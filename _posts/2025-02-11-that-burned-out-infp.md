Are you a procrastinator? 

Do you often start a project yet don't finish it for various reasons? 

Are you easily distracted? 

Are you highly creative and imaginative?

Are you an idealist behind your realist exterior? 

I check all of those questions. 

Being an INFP is not one-size-fits-all. Not all INFPs are the same. There could be INFP who don't sucks at Math like me or who's in the Medicine field whom the least course that I would take. You see, an INFP can be a glittery fairy or a goth fairy, pick your bet. As an INFP, I have lots of alter egos hidden, just waiting to be freed when I'm in the right mood. 

I couldn't count the times I took or retook the MBTI test, in case that my personality type changed. But it didn't. The result is still INFP. 

I can’t escape this. The world may change and now I’m still an INFP in MBTI. Without discovering that I am an INFP, I probably in thought spiral of being weird, eccentric, and has her own world in a negative way. If others didn't believe in MBTI, I did. The results told me that I was just unique and different, not overly weird but I have my own ways of expressing myself. 

Being 'weird' in the context of others are traits or qualities that they've observe quite beyond the ordinary or beyond the norms that they used to see or deal with. 

I have a rich inner world and I know I have more to offer when it comes to writing. It’s a long-term process. There are better writers than me out there yet here I am, still thriving without caring too much with the traffic, leads, or more readers.

As an INFP, I have a fascination of hearing different stories and perspective from other people. Although, the dominant function of mine is Fi, an analytical function and extremely idealistic, I am a perceiver and majority of the time, I judge people easily but when I talked to them and deduced something, it’s different. In the end, I’m a potato who wants to listen to stories, particularly people’s experiences.

Being a lazy, average INFP who set high standards and critical of oneself often gets me in trouble. Also, I am a chronic procrastinator but when given tight deadlines, I have to shut down that procrastinator monster and get my shits done or else I'll suffer. Procrastinating also means I need more resources to execute my plans or it's just me, being lazy. My writing drive even depends on my mood or my determination to finish a passion project. 

I get easily distracted to noises, cats, or even objects that caught my senses even if I'm so deep doing my work but sometimes, especially reading, I am so absorb that I forget my surroundings. It's also a habit of mine of having a short attention span so it's tasking to keep my mind or be present in groups. Most of the time I'm zoning out or in my imagination. 

When it comes to choosing my clothes, other INFP may have a nice fashion sense. Me? You can't count on that. I am more of comfort than fashion so I always wore clothes that are not fitted. It's always lose or for skirts, it's always below the knee or once inch above the knee. I am not a fan of crop tops, miniskirts, short skirts and anything that is 'mini' for me and clothes that show too much skin. Why would I sacrifice my comfort for a piece of fashion? It will be awkward to wore a crop top or a short skirt then trying to lower it to not show your belly button or your legs. It's useless for me. I don't wear high heels. I'm quite above average when it comes to height for Filipinas so I don't think I need them. Especially when I have to squeeze myself in jeepneys. 

I've always known that I am a sensitive person but I feel so validated after reading The Highly Sensitive Person. There's a reason why I am so worked up with caffeine or my stomach reacted with I'm under great stress. I am not fond of horror and war movies or even movies filled with violence, bombs, guns, and more. As a highly sensitive, there's an explanation why. I am easily overwhelmed in social situations that my battery gets drained. The worse case scenario was ugly crying because you were so overwhelmed with the event that you don't have to force yourself of showing up.

Protecting your inner peace is not selfish. In the world where productivity and success is prioritize, being in solitude is a need for every person out here. We are not built for an industrialized surroundings but with nature. We tend to forget that as a human being. I valued my solitude. My privacy. Even if I love my family and my friends, I need space to recover, collect and recuperate from my daily struggles. 

Life could be tough but appreciating yourself, valuing yourself, validating yourself, loving yourself is important. Indeed, the greatest love of all is loving yourself so that you are capable and ready to love others. Regardless of your personality type.
