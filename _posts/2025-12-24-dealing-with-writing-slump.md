It’s been so many days I haven’t written a piece where I can say that my creativity flows freely like a river. One of the activities to counter my writing slump was to write an essay that was filled with my point of view regarding the political landscape of the Philippines. I have written four essays about that. But even so, I’m still stuck with writing anything creative. I even created a Substack publication in order to just write down my personal experiences like this platform, but instead of overcoming my writing slump, I keep getting stuck. Even until now.

I could not find the right words. Sometimes, I think that I cannot regain that writer part of me who can write written pieces that contain metaphors and subtle nuances. I wrote short prose, which is sometimes free-flowing. Sometimes, it is very difficult to describe my emotions through words, even when translating my ideas into words nowadays.

I’m still dealing with my writing slump. I want to write. Yes, I write today. But I am not content with how I structure my sentences. I am not content with choosing my words in writing this rant essay. I have been an emotional mess these days.

Having a writing slump or writer’s block is a nightmare to writers. Especially when I write to express the excesses of my mind, escape from reality, and put down everything. Writing is a therapeutic outlet to me. It is not a hobby that can destroy you like drugs, alcohol, and other harmful outlets. I need this badly to release pent-up emotions and rewire my brain. Writing is a way to untangle my thoughts and put all of what’s been bothering me for some time now. 

I miss writing my thoughts through handwriting. Through pen and notebooks. I bought notebooks to appease myself. Even though it means having more notebooks to fill but cannot find time to write even though my work shift gives me free time to decide whether I’ll be productive or just take a rest from the long day of work – starting from early in the morning.
